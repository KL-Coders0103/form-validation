# Form-validation
This README provides a comprehensive guide on implementing form validation using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This example focuses on creating a simple, user-friendly form with validation checks to ensure that the user inputs the required information correctly before submitting.

Form validation is crucial for ensuring that users provide valid and complete information before submitting a form. This project demonstrates how to use HTML for the form structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for validation logic.

Prerequisites:-
Basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
A text editor or an integrated development environment (IDE) like Visual Studio Code.
A web browser to test the form.

Project Structure:-
The project consists of three main files:
index.html - Contains the HTML structure of the form.
styles.css - Contains the CSS styling for the form.
scripts.js - Contains the JavaScript code for form validation.


In this version:

The HTML structure defines the form and its fields.
The CSS styles the form and error messages.
The JavaScript handles form validation, displays error messages as needed, shows a success message when the form is successfully submitted, and clears the form fields after successful submission. The success message is automatically hidden after 3 seconds.
